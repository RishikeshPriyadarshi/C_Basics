//when function call itself then it is called recursive function or recursion
//find out the sum of 1st N natural numbers
//N=4
//1+2+3+4
//The logic of recursion is simple if any problem gets defined in the term of itself than that problem is of recursion
//approach:
//in step 1 we supposed
//1.fist make the function of name sum(N)...We suppose we have function sum(N) with arguments(N) passsed and it will return the value after doin the sum of N number
//2.N+(1+2+3....N-1)..>adding the value of N-1 to N will give the sum of 1st N natural number
//in step 3 we have found the Recursive case
//3.call the function sum and pass the value (N-1) inside it..i.e sum(N-1)
//so result= N+sum(N-1)
//4.if N=4..then it becomes result=4+sum(3)
//in step 5 we have found the Base case where recursion gets stopped
//5.if N==1 then result is 1 not result=1+(0)//here we do not have to perform recursion
//so step 5 is Base case and step 4 is Recursive case


Algorithm:
sum(N)
1.if(N==1)
  return(1);
2.return(N+sum(n-1));
